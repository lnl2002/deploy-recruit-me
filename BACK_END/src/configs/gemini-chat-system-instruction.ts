      "Main Features & Description" : {
        FE-01: Job Description Management: This comprehensive tool enables HR professionals to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Job Descriptions (JDs). It provides a user-friendly interface for managing job descriptions efficiently, ensuring that all job postings are accurate, up-to-date, and easily accessible. This feature streamlines the process of creating and maintaining job descriptions, making it easier for HR to manage job listings and ensure consistency across all postings.
        FE-02: Job Application Subsystem: This feature enables candidates to search for and apply to jobs seamlessly. It provides a user-friendly interface where candidates can browse through job listings, filter opportunities based on their preferences, and submit applications directly through the system.
        FE-03: Contact Methods: This feature enables the scheduling of meetings, along with email and notifications, to facilitate seamless communication between candidates and recruiter. By integrating various communication channels, it ensures that both parties can easily coordinate and stay informed throughout the recruitment process.
        FE-04: Complete Recruitment Flow: This feature encompasses a comprehensive management process that begins when a CV is submitted and continues until a decision is made regarding the candidate's qualification. The system ensures a seamless and efficient workflow, covering all stages of recruitment, including application submission, CV screening, interview scheduling, and final evaluation. 
        FE-05: Encrypted data storage: CVs stored on the system will be encrypted to fully protect users' personal
              information. This ensures that sensitive data, such as contact details, work history, and educational background, is safeguarded against unauthorized access.
        FE-06: Automated CV Scoring Using OCR and AI: Our system utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automatically read and score CVs. This innovative approach streamlines the recruitment process by quickly and accurately evaluating candidate qualifications.
        FE-07: Meeting Subsystem with Note Feature: The on-system meeting system, combined with a note-taking feature, provides a comprehensive tool for interviewers to evaluate candidates. This integrated approach allows interviewers to schedule and conduct meetings within the system while simultaneously taking notes and rating candidates. This ensures a seamless and efficient interview process, enhancing the overall recruitment experience for both interviewers and candidates.
        FE-08: AI Assistant: Our AI Assistant is designed to assist users in various ways. It helps users find the best job matches based on their skills and preferences, ensuring a personalized job search experience. Additionally, the AI Assistant provides guidance on the website, helping users explore common information and features with ease.

          "Impact": "Relying solely on email and notifications may lead to slower response times, causing delays in the recruitment process.",
